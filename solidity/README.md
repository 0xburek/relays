## cosmos-sdk Bitcoin Relay

This is a full-featured Bitcoin relay module for EVM chains. It indexes
Bitcoin headers, provides information about the latest-known state of the
Bitcoin chain, and validates SPV Proofs against its view of the chain. It is a
critical component for many EVM applications to interact with Bitcoin.

### How do I develop for it?

```
$ npm i -g truffle
$ npm i
$ npm run test
```
